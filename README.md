# Hi, I'm Lachlan

I'm an IT student at Monash University and an aspiring software developer.

I use GitHub a lot for working on university assignments and my own private projects, hence all the commits in private repos you may see.

### My projects here on GitHub:

Console Applications üñ•Ô∏è
- Python
  - [RubiksCube](https://github.com/lachlantait/RubiksCube) - A simple Rubik's Cube simulator that runs in the terminal

More to come!
